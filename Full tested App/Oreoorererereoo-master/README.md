# Rules

The input is lowercase, a non-empty string with no whitespace containing any combination of the strings "o" and "re", and containing only those strings.

The string "o" represents the solid cookie, while the string "re" represents the filling.

The output must be a stacked cookie that is as wide as the input string.

The output may not be an array of strings.

The cookie must overlap the filling by one character on each side.

The characters used for the output don't have to match the output below (█ and ░), they just have to be different non-whitespace characters for the two parts of the cookie.

The whitespace padding on the left side of the filling is required, and any trailing whitespace is optional.
